📝 Introduction
  This project focuses on controlling LEDs using STM32 microcontrollers, simulated on Proteus software.  
  The project includes:
  - LED Bar Control: Controlling LED running effects.
  - LED Matrix Control: Displaying characters or basic visual effects.

⚙️ Technologies Used
- Keil uVision5
- STM32CubeMX
- Proteus
- STM32 Microcontroller

📂 Project Files
- `LED Control.rar`: Project for LED bar control.
- `LED Matrix.zip`: Project for LED matrix control.

🚀 How to Run the Simulation
1. Open the project files using **Keil uVision5** to review and build the code.
2. Open the simulation files in **Proteus**.
3. Load the generated `.hex` file into the STM32 microcontroller in Proteus.
4. Run the simulation and observe the LED behaviors.
